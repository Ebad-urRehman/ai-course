### a. Sub types of Quantitative data : 
##### A. Discrete :
Variables only be measured in certain numbers only(e.g. Number of cars and books can be 1,2,3 but can’t be 3.45 etc)
##### B. Continuous :
Can take any numerical value(e.g. Weights, heights can be 89, 45, 23.231 etc)
Data can have two forms.

##### 1. Quantitative Data(Continuous) :
Data measured with numbers. Can perform calculations on it.
##### 2. Qualitative Data(Categorical) : 
Refers to placing things in different categories.(color, grade)
    

### b. Sub types of Categorical data : 

##### A. Categorical and nominal : 
Have names but no logical ordering(e.g. color)

##### B. Categorical and ordinal : 
Have logical ordering(e.g. grades)

### Types of Graphs for representing data.
#### - Categorical Data(pie chart,bar charts)
#### - Quantitative Data(histograms, line plot, scatter plot)

### A. Categorical Data 
#### 1. Pie Chart
Used to show relative size of each value/category to the whole data/values/categories.

#### 2. Bar Chart
Displays the frequency of each value/category/ value

  

### B. Quantitative Data 
#### 1. Histograms
Histogram consists of frequencies on y-axis and data values on x-axis, Data is divided into certain intervals called bins, and frequencies of all data values between these intervals are represented in histograms.

Histograms are a king of frequency distribution.
-> In a frequency distribution table last value is consider excluded from interval, due to the fact that values can be continuous here, 

ForExample if we write intervals/bins like this.
10-19
20-29

Then if a situation is arised where we have to put value 19.5 in any interval, there arises a confusion to put value 19.5 in any of the interval, so intervals always written like this.

10-20
20-30

Now we consider 20 excluded by the first interval, and included in the second interval. So 19.5 lies in first interval.

#### 2. Stem Plots
Similar like histograms but represented in stems and leaves from left to right.

##### Stem : every number except last number

##### Leaf : last number.
Both are separated by a line

Actual data points are : 23, 25, 36, and 37

|       |        |        |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| Stems | leaves | leaves |
| 2     | 3      | 5      |
| 3     | 6      | 7      |

**If a stem plot has too many stems then we split it.**
-> rule : duplicate each stem
Reducing Stems when too many stems : 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Stem|Leaf|
|1|2|
|2|2|
|3|2|
|4|2|
|5|2|
|6|3|
|7|3|
|8|3|
|9|3|
|10|3|

Reduced Stem plot.

|      |      |
| ---- | ---- |
| Stem | leaf |
| 1-6  | 2    |
| 6-10 | 3    |

Reducing Stems when leafs are too much

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Stem|leaf|leaf|leaf|leaf|leaf|leaf|leaf|leaf|leaf|leaf|
