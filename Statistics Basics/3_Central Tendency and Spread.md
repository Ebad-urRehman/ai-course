Measure of Central tendency : 
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode

#### 1. Mean : Also called Arithmetic Average, Formula
Summation of all data values divided by the number of data items in the dataset.
  
#### 2. Median : 
The data value that is positioned  between the ordered dataset in either ascending or descending order. For even numbers, the median is an average of two numbers in the middle.

#### 3. Mode :
Most frequently observed value in a dataset. 


### Difference between Mean and Median

|                       |                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Mean                  | Median                                |
| Physical Middle point | Numerical middle point/ balance point |

### Measure of Spread :  
##### 1. Range :
- max - min (how much room a distribution takes)

##### 2. Standard Deviation : 
- Is the measure of how far data items are from the mean. 

#### -> Effect of Transforming Data on spread and Center : 
Adding a number n to every data item and finding mean is same as mean of actual dataset + that number

Lets say we add 5

Adding 5 our graph looks like we have moved our whole graph/distribution right 5 points. So mean should also

Previous mean + 5

Previous mean is at 135.6
So new mean is at point 140.6
 
### How spread changes :  
As we move all the data points equally so spread(1. distance between mean and all data points, and 2. range) remains the same for old and new data values.

In other words, Standard deviation and range remains the same.

### Transforming Data : 
By addition and subtractions only measures of center got effected.
What about multiplication and division.
Yes the effect on both centre and spread is as follows, if all the data points are multiplied by 5.

new_mean = prev_mean * 5

new_spread = old_spread * 5


### Effect of Outliers on Spread and Center : 

#### Outlier : 
- Data point that is either too large, or smaller as compared to dataset points, also called numerically distant value.

[21, 20, 34, 5000, 34]

Can you find the outlier in the above dataset?
Outlier effects the mean because a very large or small value has significant impact on mean.

Example : 

25, 24, 26, 200, 45 mean is 64

*200* is an outlier above

*Let’s check without outlier*176

25, 24, 26, 45 mean is *30* without outlier

You can see that outliers mean it seemed too far away from average value just due to an outlier value 200.

  It also has a significant impact on range.

Range With outlier is 200-24 = *176*

Range Without outlier is 45-24 = *21*

Median, mode do not affected much by outliers
