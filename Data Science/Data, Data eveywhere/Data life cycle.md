Phases of Data Life Cycle.

1. Planning(Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.)
2. Capture(Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.)
3. Manage(Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.)
4. Analyze(Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.)
5. Archive(Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.)
6. Destroy(Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.)
