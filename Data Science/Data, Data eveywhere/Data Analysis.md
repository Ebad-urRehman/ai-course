#### Data Analysis
The collection transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

#### Data Analyst 
Someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to help make informed decisions.

- Comes from many different backgrounds and have all kinds of life experiences
- No need for decade of experiences to get started
- Many are self taught


*Data! Data! Data! I can't make bricks without clay!* 


*Data Analytics* : Science of Data
*Data :* Collection of Facts.


#### Data analytics Everyday life
Tons of data is being produce everyday.
Data helps making companies informed decisions.
Turning data into insights. 

Business take actions to that insights and make good decisions to expand businesses.


#### Six Steps of data analysis.
Lets take example of People Analytics.

**People analytics** is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company’s workforce in order to gain insights to improve how the company operates.

**Problem :**
- The purpose is to address a business problem related to high employee turnover among new hires.

The six steps of the data analysis process that you have been learning in this program are: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share,** and **act**.

#### 1. Ask
The team defined the problem by asking key questions, such as what new employees need to succeed and what factors might lead to dissatisfaction
#### 2. Prepare
Planned to project timeline and gathered data through an online survey. Prepare specific questions about employee satisfaction and set rules for data privacy, ensuring access restrictions to raw data.
#### 3. Process
The team collect data ethically, with employees' consent. They cleaned and organized the data, stored it securely, and protect it.
- restrict access
- clean data remove irrelevant info
- upload it to internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security
#### 4. Analyze
Extract conclusions from data
Let's say they concluded.
- Employees who experienced a long and complicated hiring process were most likely to leave the company.
    
- Employees who experienced an efficient and transparent evaluation and feedback process were most likely to remain with the company.

Document it.

#### 5.Share
The results were shared with managers in a responsible and contextual manner. Managers were asked to communicate the findings to their teams and discuss improvements.

#### 6. Act
Now company decided how to **implement changes and take actions** based on thier findings.

They may recommend : 

- Standardize the hiring and evaluation process for employees based on the most efficient and transparent practices.
- Conduct the same survey annually and compare results with those from the previous year.

A year later they can compare results.



*Data analyst is an explorer, a detective, and an artist all rolled into one*

Specialization in filed is important.
Which type of flavour suits you good
- Machine learning(make a lot of decisions)
- Statistics(making a little bit of decisions)
- Analytics(getting inspiration, speed, potentials, creative open ended projects)


#### Egyption ancient History : 
Data analysis is rooted in statistics, which has a pretty long history itself. Archaeologists mark the start of statistics in ancient Egypt with the building of the pyramids. The ancient Egyptians were masters of organizing data. They documented their calculations and theories on papyri (paper-like materials), which are now viewed as the earliest examples of spreadsheets and checklists. Today’s data analysts owe a lot to those brilliant scribes

[[Dell EMC DA Process]] 

#### Data ecosystems
  The various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data.
#### Cloud 
Cloud is a place to keep data online, rather than a computer hard drive.
- Virtual place
- big role in data ecosystem


### Difference between Data Scientist and Data Analyst.

- Data scientists create new questions using data
- Data analysts find answers to existing questions.


#### Difference between Data analysis and Data Analytics.
- The collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making. -> Data analysis.
- Data analytics is the science of data.


#### How data informs better decisions
##### Data Driven Decision Making.
Using facts to guide business strategy.

#### Step 1 : Figuring out business need.
Example : improving product, growing business, unhappy employees or customers.

Some time data driven strategy build on what thing worked in the past, other times it can guide a business to branch out in a whole new direction.

Data alone will never be as powerful as data combined with human experience, observations, and sometimes even intuition.

#### Subject Matter Experts.
Have ability to look at result of data analysis and identify any inconsistencies, make sense of higlighted areas.

#### Data detectives :
Have similar roles as data analysts, but use Gut instinct
##### Gut Instinct
Gut instinct is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation.
- but this can be dangerous.
- as data analysis is to be performed in medical field too, and also may yield wrong results in business driven processes.



## Data + business knowledge = mystery solved

Blending data with business knowledge, plus maybe a touch of gut instinct, will be a common part of your process as a junior data analyst.


### Analytical Skills
Qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts.

- Already have skills just have to acknowledge them.


### Five Essential Analytical Skills
- Curiosity(wanting to learn something)
- Understanding context(1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are in counting context)
- Having a technical mindset(Ability to break things down into smaller steps)
- Data design(How you organize information)
- Data strategy(Management of people, processes and tools)



#thinking

### Thinking Analytically
Types of thinking
- Critical thinking
- Creative thinking
- Analytical thinking
A person may be great in all three by practice.
#### Analytical thinking
Identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in organized step-by-step manner.

#### 5 key aspects of Analytical thinking
1. Visualization(graphical representation of information)
2. Being Strategic(Strategy helps us know all our data is value able and accomplish our goals with quality) -> key to stay focus and on track.
3. Problem Oriented(identify, and solve problem)
4. Able to identify Correlation between two or more pieces/features of data.(not same as causation)
5. Big picture and detail oriented thinking.

### Advantages of different types of thinking
#### Critical thinking.
Find out right questions to ask.

Finding root cause.

#### The 5 why's
nested whys.
why not this -> why not that -> upto 5

blueberry example.

#### Where are gaps in our process?
DA use gap analysis to answer that.

##### Gap Analysis.
A method for examining and evaluating how a process works currently in order to get you want to be in future.
comparison between where are you now and where you wanted to be.

## The importance of fairness in business decisions
*Issue* is the topic or subject to investigate
*Question* is designed to discover information
*Problem* is an obstacle or complication that need to be worked out.

observation and intuition are powerful tools in decision making. but they are only part of the picture.
Data is the big picture of problems(helps us see the whole things).

### Understand Data and Fairness
Data based on facts how can it be unfair?

**Fairness** is ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias.

Some time conclusions made from data can be true but unfair.
Examples : where data is not taking the incomplete picture of whole situation.
- Not thinking about other surrounding data that are key factors in results.(biased toward some particular data)
- not including social context


# Consider fairness

Previously, you learned that part of a data professional’s responsibility is to make certain that their analysis is fair. **Fairness** means ensuring your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias. This can be challenging, but if the analysis is not objective, the conclusions can be misleading and even harmful. In this reading, you’re going to explore some best practices you can use to guide your work toward a more fair analysis!

## Consider fairness

Following are some strategies that support fair analysis:

| **Best practice**                          | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Example**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Consider all of the available data         | Part of your job as a data analyst is to determine what data is going to be useful for your analysis. Often there will be data that isn’t relevant to what you’re focusing on or doesn’t seem to align with your expectations. But you can’t just ignore it; it’s critical to consider all of the available data so that your analysis reflects the truth and not just your own expectations.                                                                                                                                       | A state’s Department of Transportation is interested in measuring traffic patterns on holidays. At first, they only include metrics related to traffic volumes and the fact that the days are holidays. But the data team realizes they failed to consider how weather on these holidays might also affect traffic volumes. Considering this additional data helps them gain more complete insights.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Identify surrounding factors               | As you’ll learn throughout these courses, context is key for you and your stakeholders to understand the final conclusions of any analysis. Similar to considering all of the data, you also must understand surrounding factors that could influence the insights you’re gaining.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | A human resources department wants to better plan for employee vacation time in order to anticipate staffing needs. HR uses a list of national bank holidays as a key part of the data-gathering process. But they fail to consider important holidays that aren’t on the bank calendar, which introduces bias against employees who celebrate them. It also gives HR less useful results because bank holidays may not necessarily apply to their actual employee population.                                                                                                     |
| Include self-reported data                 | **Self-reporting** is a data collection technique where participants provide information about themselves. Self-reported data can be a great way to introduce fairness in your data collection process. People bring conscious and unconscious bias to their observations about the world, including about other people. Using self-reporting methods to collect data can help avoid these observer biases. Additionally, separating self-reported data from other data you collect provides important context to your conclusions! | A data analyst is working on a project for a brick-and-mortar retailer. Their goal is to learn more about their customer base. This data analyst knows they need to consider fairness when they collect data; they decide to create a survey so that customers can self-report information about themselves. By doing that, they avoid bias that might be introduced with other demographic data collection methods. For example, if they had sales associates report their observations about customers, they might introduce any unconscious bias the employees had to the data. |
| Use oversampling effectively               | When collecting data about a population, it’s important to be aware of the actual makeup of that population. Sometimes, oversampling can help you represent groups in that population that otherwise wouldn’t be represented fairly. **Oversampling** is the process of increasing the sample size of nondominant groups in a population. This can help you better represent them and address imbalanced datasets.                                                                                                                  | A fitness company is releasing new digital content for users of their equipment. They are interested in designing content that appeals to different users, knowing that different people may interact with their equipment in different ways. For example, part of their user-base is age 70 or older. In order to represent these users, they oversample them in their data. That way, decisions they make about their fitness content will be more inclusive.                                                                                                                    |
| Think about fairness from beginning to end | To ensure that your analysis and final conclusions are fair, be sure to consider fairness from the earliest stages of a project to when you act on the data insights. This means that data collection, cleaning, processing, and analysis are all performed with fairness in mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | A data team kicks off a project by including fairness measures in their data-collection process. These measures include oversampling their population and using self-reported data. However, they fail to inform stakeholders about these measures during the presentation. As a result, stakeholders leave with skewed understandings of the data. Learning from this experience, they add key information about fairness considerations to future stakeholder presentations.                                                                                                     |

## Key takeaways

As a data professional, you will need to ensure you always consider fairness. This will allow you to avoid creating or reinforcing bias or accidentally drawing misleading conclusions. Using these best practices can help guide your analysis and make you a better data professional!
