It is basically the combination of structure and unstructured data that organization collects and analyze

#### Usage : 
Big data is used in machine learning and other advanced analytics to solve business problems


### Characteristics of Big Data
- Velocity
- Volume
- Variety
- Veracity
- Value

#### Velocity
- Speed at which data accumulates ,data is being generated extremely fast, in a process that never stops.

#### Volume
Volume is scale of data or increase in the amount of data stored.

#### Variety :
Variety is diversity of data, Structured data fits neatly into rows and columns, in relational databases wile unstructured data is not organized in a pre-defined way, like tweets, videos, images etc.
Also refers to data coming from different resources.

#### Veracity :
Quality and origin of data, and its conformity to facts and accuracy, 

Attributes include consistency, completeness, integrity, and ambiguity.

#### Value : 
Value is our ability and need to turn data into value. Value isn't just profit.
It may have medical or social benefits, as well as customer, employee, or personal satisfaction.


### Structured Data : 
Structured data refers to the data in the form of rows, and columns, as this data is in more structure format the relation of an element to a row and column is clear.

Databases are good examples of structured data.

### Unstructured Data : 
Data in other file formats like audio files, and videos files are unstructured data, there is no quick way of making sense of such data. Complex neural networks can only understand them for something useful.

### Semi Structured Data
Semi structure data contain some structure, and can be easily converted into a structured format like JSON file format which stores a map or dictionary like format is an example of semi-structured data.
Other examples
XML files, YAML files
NoSQL databases.
