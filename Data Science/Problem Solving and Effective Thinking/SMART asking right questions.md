Today's weather is nice, not it is?

### Closed-ended question
Is today's weather good?

####  Too Vague and lack context : 
Do you like vanilla or chocolate?

####  Ask phase
Questions are asked in the first phase of data analysis, therefore they are important for the whole process.

Right questions in data analysis must follows the SMART methodology.

#### - Specific : 
- Simple
- Measure able
- Action-oriented
- Relevant
- Time-bound

#### 1. Specific : 
Simple, significant, and focused on a single topic, or closely related ideas.

*Example*
 ~~Are kids getting enough exercise these days?~~
What percentage of kids achieve the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity at least five days a weak.

~~Why does it matter that Pine Barrens tree frogs started disappearing?~~
What environment factors changed in Durham, between 1983 and 2004 that could cause Pine Barrens tree frogs to disappear from the Sandhills Regions?

#### 5. Timed-bounded Questions

| **Specific:**<br><br>Is the question specific? Does it address the problem? Does it have context? Will it uncover a lot of the information you need? | **Measurable:** Will the question give you answers that you can measure? | **Action-oriented:** Will the answers provide information that helps you devise some type of plan? | **Relevant:** Is the question about the particular problem you are trying to solve? | **Time-bound:** Are the answers relevant to the specific time being studied? |
### Ask the right type of questions


You can apply the SMART framework to all types of questions. The type of questions you ask can help you explore deeper with your data. Consider the ways your questions help you examine objectives, audience, time, security, and resources.

Some common topics for questions include: 

- **Objectives**
    
- **Audience**
    
- **Time**
    
- **Resources**
    
- **Security**


### Take good notes
It is important to take good notes during your conversation. Your notes should be comprehensive and useful. To help you capture meaningful notes, you should stick to a process of asking a question, clarifying your understanding of their response, and then briefly recording it in your notes.

Remember: If a question is worth asking, then the answer is worth recording. Commit yourself to taking great notes during your conversation.

Helpful aspects of your conversation to note include:

- **Facts:** Write down any concrete piece of information, such as dates, times, names, and other specifics.
    
- **Context:** Facts without context are useless. Note any relevant details that are needed in order to understand the information you gather.
    
- **Unknowns:** Sometimes you may miss an important question during a conversation. Make a note when this happens so you can figure out the answer later. 
    

For example, if the previous SMART questions led the ice cream shop owner to propose a project to analyze customer flavor preferences, your notes might appear something like this:

- **Project**: Collect customer flavor preference data.
    
- **Overall business goal**: Use data to offer or create more popular flavors.
    
- **Two data sources**: Cash register receipts and completed customer surveys (email).
    
- **Target completion date:** Q2 
    
- **To do:** Call back later and speak with the manager about the location of survey data.
    

The notes you will take will differ greatly based on the data conversation you have. The important thing is that your notes are clear, organized, and concise.

Now you are ready to have a great conversation about data in real life.
