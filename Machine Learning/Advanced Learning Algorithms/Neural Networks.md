Neural Networks are inspired by how our brain works.

How human brain works.

Neural Networks originated in 1950's and gain popularity in 1980's and early 1990's for hand written digit recognition.

Now it is revolutionalizing to speech recognition to images, to text(NLP)

#### Neurons in brain :

Input wires are called dendrites, and output neurons are called axon. 
A neuron sends an electrical pulse as output which becomes an input for another neuron.

#### Mathematical Model of neuron
Takes in a number as input and spits out a number as output.

This is an analogy, every year neuroscientists are discovering new secrets of our brain. 
Mathematical neurons are very simplified version of neuron as compared to biological brain neurons.


#### Why neural networks are at hype now if they are discovered a very long ago

Now as the every thing is digitalized so the data for everything is availible in digit format that's why deep learning has much more applications nowadays as compared to a single or more decades ago.

With large amount of data deep learning algorithms that uses neural networks have much more efficiency as compared to traditional machine learning algorithms like regression, and classification.

Modern GPUs are designed to process that larger data for efficiency and performance.


### Demand Prediction
Previously we are using sigmoid function for the whole classification task,  now every neuron has an activation handled by a sigmoid function called a. This activation function outputs the probability of the event.

For example we have to predict the T-Shirt type of a company to be a top seller or not it is basically a binary classification task, but we are doing it by deep learning so a single activation function looks like this.

- Neuron is like a little computer whose only job is to input a number or a set of numbers and output the probability.
